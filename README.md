# CirSTAG
Code for CirSTAG — Circuit Stability Analysis on Graph-based Manifolds — is an open-source implementation of the framework we presented at DAC 2025. CirSTAG is a spectral method for circuit-level robustness and stability analysis of graph neural networks. We introduce the CirSTAG score, a distance-mapping-distortion metric that upper-bounds the local Lipschitz constant on a circuit manifold and quantifies a model’s sensitivity to feature or topological perturbations.
